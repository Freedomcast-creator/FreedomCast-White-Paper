# 🕊️ FreedomCast: A Platform for the People

**FreedomCast** is a decentralized, censorship-resistant communication protocol built for survival. Whether you're a whistleblower, dissident, journalist, protester, or just someone who believes in truth and free speech — this platform is for you.

## 🔥 Why FreedomCast?

Authoritarianism is rising. Platforms are being weaponized. Truth is being buried.

FreedomCast is being built as a last-line defense:  
- No corporate gatekeepers  
- No government censors  
- No infrastructure dependencies

This is communication for when the lights go out — or when someone turns them off on purpose.
