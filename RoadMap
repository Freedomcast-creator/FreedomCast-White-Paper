# 🚧 FreedomCast Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the proposed stages for building FreedomCast — a censorship-resistant, decentralized communication protocol for use in high-risk, high-suppression environments.

The system is modular and open to community input. These phases reflect both technical milestones and ethical imperatives.

---

## ✅ Phase 0: Foundation (Current)

- [x] Draft and publish whitepaper and developer one-pager
- [x] Launch public GitHub repository
- [ ] Recruit a lead maintainer / technical steward
- [ ] Open issues for modular protocol components
- [ ] Identify related open-source technologies to build upon

---

## 🔧 Phase 1: MVP Development

**Goal:** Build a minimal, functioning prototype demonstrating the core functionality.

### Features:
- [ ] End-to-end encrypted messaging (peer-to-peer or small broadcast)
- [ ] Optional public broadcast via decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS)
- [ ] Identity model (anonymous + verified trust anchors)
- [ ] Failsafe “sneakernet” export/import (via USB, QR, or local networks)
- [ ] Proof-of-concept moderation / trust token demo

---

## 🔐 Phase 2: Security & Resilience

**Goal:** Fortify communications against interception, takedown, and infiltration.

- [ ] Harden encryption & transport protocols
- [ ] Add pluggable transports for mesh, satellite, or delay-tolerant networks
- [ ] Implement data sharding + replication for failover
- [ ] Begin zero-knowledge proof system for reputation & moderation

---

## 🌍 Phase 3: Decentralized Trust & Governance

**Goal:** Enable a permissionless, self-sustaining communication ecosystem.

- [ ] Define DAO-like governance model (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Token-based trust signaling (non-monetary, decentralized reputation)
- [ ] Global/local consensus for signal-boosting trusted messages
- [ ] Human appeals for flagged/blocked content
- [ ] Add translation + accessibility layers

---

## 🧩 Phase 4: Integration & Outreach

- [ ] Create CLI and lightweight mobile client
- [ ] Partner with censorship resistance, privacy, or whistleblower orgs
- [ ] Launch .onion mirror and IPFS mirror of repo
- [ ] Outreach to dev communities (Reddit, Hacker News, Mastodon, Bluesky)
- [ ] Gather feedback + iterate

---

## 🌱 Ongoing

- Maintain modular, community-led codebase
- Publish updates and issue templates for new contributors
- Host decentralized testnets or simulated fail-state use cases
- Seek external audits (security, ethics, legal)
